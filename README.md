```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```


##  Practice Questions


1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT 
	album,
	MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
	MIN(energy) as lowest_energery
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
	album,
	highest_energy - lowest_energery as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```
   
5. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
6. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.


Here’s an updated section for your **Spotify Advanced SQL Project and Query Optimization** README, focusing on the query optimization task you performed. You can include the specific screenshots and graphs as described.

## Query Optimization Technique 

To improve query performance, we carried out the following optimization process:

- **Initial Query Performance Analysis Using `EXPLAIN`**
    - We began by analyzing the performance of a query using the `EXPLAIN` function.
    - The query retrieved tracks based on the `artist` column, and the performance metrics were as follows:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **7 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.17 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result before optimization:

- **Index Creation on the `artist` Column**
    - To optimize the query performance, we created an index on the `artist` column. This ensures faster retrieval of rows where the artist is queried.
    - **SQL command** for creating the index:
      ```sql
      CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify_tracks(artist);
      ```

- **Performance Analysis After Index Creation**
    - After creating the index, we ran the same query again and observed significant improvements in performance:
        - Execution time (E.T.): **0.153 ms**
        - Planning time (P.T.): **0.152 ms**
    - Below is the **screenshot** of the `EXPLAIN` result after index creation:
    -

- **Graphical Performance Comparison**
    - A graph illustrating the comparison between the initial query execution time and the optimized query execution time after index creation.
    - **Graph view** shows the significant drop in both execution and planning times:
    -

      ![Spotify Graphical View 3](images/spotify_graphical%20view%203.png)

This optimization shows how indexing can drastically reduce query time, improving the overall performance of our database operations in the Spotify project.

## Technology Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **SQL Queries**: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions
- **Tools**: pgAdmin 4 (or any SQL editor), PostgreSQL (via Homebrew, Docker, or direct installation)

## How to Run the Project
1. Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin (if not already installed).
2. Set up the database schema and tables using the provided normalization structure.
3. Insert the sample data into the respective tables.
4. Execute SQL queries to solve the listed problems.
5. Explore query optimization techniques for large datasets.

---

## Next Steps
- **Visualize the Data**: Use a data visualization tool like **Tableau** or **Power BI** to create dashboards based on the query results.
- **Expand Dataset**: Add more rows to the dataset for broader analysis and scalability testing.
- **Advanced Querying**: Dive deeper into query optimization and explore the performance of SQL queries on larger datasets.
